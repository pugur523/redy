# i18n data

This directory contains code automatically generated by `//src/build/scripts/i18n_gen.py` called on build. It will parse `.toml` language files in the `//src/build/resources/i18n/` directory and convert them into constant arrays that are c++ friendly, so we do not change these `.h` files directly but change `//src/build/resources/i18n/*.toml` to update translation data.
